<H2>Sorry - Not Currently Available</H2>
The ability to create a full Google Calendar Entry is something we will hopefully be able to provide to you in the future. This is not a particularly difficult technical problem, though does take considerable effort from our design, development, testing and technical  writing team and as we are currently offering My Accessible Google - Calendar for free are not in a position to do anything about.
<P>If you are willing to pay a regular subscription, can help us in finding a grant to pay for the effort, or can help us to get Google's attention and some of their financial resources (<A HREF="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/accessibilityfeedback/">Send them a message for us please)</A> then we would love to implement this functionality for you. If we have enough subscribers then we will let you know about any changes on this front, so <A HREF="../contact.html">let us know</A> if you would be interested in paying a very small annual fee to access more functionality.
