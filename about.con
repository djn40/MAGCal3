<H1 ID="gen_mc">About My Accessible Google</H1>
The range of Google applications is growing all the time, and there is a number of these applications which are now being used by more and more people, both in a desktop environment as well as via the mobile phone. The issue is that many of these applications have poor design from a sight accessibility perspective. In fact some are not useable at all, such as Google Calendar. So after the success of <A HREF="http://www.povidi.com/yourtube">YourTube</A> Povidi decided to look more closely at what could be done about this. We worked closely with Dylan Neale who had done a lot of research into using the Google API (computer jargon for allowing computer code to talk to google), and our first offering is a simple and efficient mechanism for accessing the google calendar, reviewing appointments and adding simple entries.
<P>We are aware that moves are afoot in the area of google accessibility and have put My Accessible Google Calendar together over a 3 week period to show what can be done. Many other google applications can have a different design front end we would love to be involved in this process.
<P> Further applications will be looked at if there is enough demand for them so please <A HREF="../contact.html">let us know what you think.</A>
<P>If you find the experience here a good one then please also <A HREF="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/accessibilityfeedback/">let Google know,</A> we would love to work with them on making their wonderful apps more accessible.
